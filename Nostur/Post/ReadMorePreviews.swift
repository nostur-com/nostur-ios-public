Social has now decided to give her ‚Ç¨124 stating on the letter that she needs to manage her utility consumption better. The atrocity of this is out of this world.\n\nOur elders, those who've paid their dues all their life, those who've rebuild this country are literally being abandoned while others who come to this country get full dentals, full payment of rents, deposits, utilities, back payments FFS they even get money to buy a fucking car.\n\nSo I spent the day comforting my mother and I'm going on Monday to file an official complaint at social services while pressing charges with the social court at the same time.\n\nWe're getting to a point where the actions of the government and their treatment of our elders is unacceptable.","tags":[["client","noStrudel","31990:266815e0c9210dfa324c6cba3573b14bee49da4209a9456f9484e5106cd408a5:1686066542546"]],"kind":1}]"###,
